## future projects / todo list

### Complete the zabbix tree maker project
It's a python + etetoolkit script set for bulk insert and hierarchical creation of maps, screen, IT services, dependancies.

It works quite well but it needs lots of improvements (error checking, parametrization of hardcoded files, override behavoir etc).

Contact me directly if interested

### Complete the "Table periodic table"
Exactly what says on the tin: it's a table based on the period table of elements. 

It will be made of 3 layers of different wood (base, plaques and letters), each layer cut off with a [High Z s1000 CNC](http://www.cnc-router-store.com/products/t-series-high-quality-ball-screws/high-z-s-1000t-cnc-router-cnc-engraver-1000-x-600-x-110-mm-ball-screws/)

The current "demo" is made from MDF, plywood and masonite:
